# C-NEWS  
**Community Narrative Early Warning System**

> A decision-support platform designed to provide early situational awareness of emerging online narrative trends through explainable, human-in-the-loop analysis.

---

## 🧭 Overview

C-NEWS is a **preventive, awareness-oriented analytics platform** that helps institutions understand how potentially harmful narratives emerge and evolve in public online spaces.

The system is designed to support **early awareness and informed human decision-making**, not automated enforcement.

---

## 🎯 Problem Context

Rapid dissemination of online narratives can sometimes contribute to:
- Social misunderstanding
- Community tension
- Misinformation amplification

Existing approaches are often reactive and lack early visibility into **how narratives form and spread over time**.

---

## 💡 Solution Summary

C-NEWS provides:

- Narrative-level trend analysis  
- Early warning indicators (non-alarmist)  
- Explainable insights instead of black-box scores  
- Human-in-the-loop review workflows  
- Exportable summaries for reporting and briefing  

The platform focuses on **patterns and trends**, not individuals.

---

## 🧩 Core Principles

- **Prevention over reaction**
- **Explainability over opacity**
- **Human judgment over automation**
- **Safety and proportionality by design**

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Scope Boundaries

C-NEWS explicitly:

- Does **not** track individuals  
- Does **not** access private communications  
- Does **not** automate enforcement  
- Does **not** assign intent, guilt, or prediction  

All outputs are **advisory only**.
